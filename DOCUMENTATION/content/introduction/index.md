A full PHP development environment for Docker.

Includes pre-packaged Docker Images, all pre-configured to provide a wonderful PHP development environment.

Mage2dock is well known in the Magento community, as the project started with single focus on running Magento projects on Docker. Later and due to the large adoption from the PHP community, it started supporting other PHP projects like Symfony, CodeIgniter, WordPress, Drupal...

```shell
cp env-example .env
```

3 - Run your containers:

```shell
docker-compose up -d nginx mysql redis beanstalkd
```

4 - Open your project's `.env` file and set the following:

```shell
DB_HOST=mysql
REDIS_HOST=redis
QUEUE_HOST=beanstalkd
```

5 - Open your browser and visit localhost: `http://localhost`.

```shell
That's it! enjoy :)
```

## Supported Software (Images)

In adhering to the separation of concerns principle as promoted by Docker, Mage2dock runs each software on its own Container.
You can turn On/Off as many instances of as any container without worrying about the configurations, everything works like a charm.

<a name="what-is-docker"></a>
## What is Docker?

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.
Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.
With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.
By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.





<a name="why-docker-not-vagrant"></a>
## Why Docker not Vagrant!?

[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) creates Virtual Machines in minutes while Docker creates Virtual Containers in seconds.

Instead of providing a full Virtual Machines, like you get with Vagrant, Docker provides you **lightweight** Virtual Containers, that share the same kernel and allow to safely execute independent processes.

In addition to the speed, Docker gives tons of features that cannot be achieved with Vagrant.

Most importantly Docker can run on Development and on Production (same environment everywhere). While Vagrant is designed for Development only, (so you have to re-provision your server on Production every time).
